# Pints and Stems

## Description

## Road Map
	
	-- Write new MongoDB JSON Schema (only extra thing is array of objects for
	users and favorite wines)

	-- Attach page refresh functions to pages (triggering data update from wine
	list)

	-- Integrate the REST API that gives the app the profile quiz answers

	-- Switch from mongodb-stitch-react sdk to mongodb-realm-react sdk

	-- Remove AsyncStorage from the app
